# DevPort

DevPort is a personal project on which i have hopes to connect me to a more "real world" work environment.

In this project i am aiming at learning NestJS, Prisma and Redis.

While building DevPort i will be simulating a SaaS API service with user authentication, API key generation, rate limiting, usage analytics and background jobs.

# What is DevPort?

DevPort is a platform where developers can register, create personal API projects, manage API tokens and track usage.
